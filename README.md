### Privacy by Design (by [Dr. Laurens Sion](https://sion.info/))

| **When** | Tuesday, 17 November 2020, 12:30 - 13:30 |
| --- | --- |
| **Location** | online only |
| **Conferencing** | [https://meet.jit.si/20201117-CIF-Privacy-by-Design](https://meet.jit.si/20201117-CIF-Privacy-by-Design) |
| **Abstract** | Building software-intensive systems that respect the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection requires explicitly addressing data protection issues at the early development stages. Data Protection by Design (DPbD)—as coined by Article 25(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—therefore calls for an iterative approach based on (i) the notion of risk to data subjects, (ii) a close collaboration between the involved stakeholders, and (iii) accountable decision-making. <br> In practice, however, the legal reasoning behind DPbD is often conducted on the basis of informal system descriptions that lack systematicity and reproducibility. This affects the quality of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)—i. e. the concrete manifestation of DPbD at the organizational level. This is a major stumbling block when it comes to conducting a comprehensive and durable assessment of the risks that takes both the legal and technical complexities into account. <br> In this talk, I present DPMF: a data protection modeling framework that allows for a comprehensive and accurate description of the data processing operations in terms of the key concepts used in the GDPR. The proposed modeling approach accommodates a number of legal reasonings and assessments that are commonly addressed in a DPIA exercise (e. g., the compatibility of purposes). The DPMF is supported in a prototype modeling tool and its practical applicability is validated in the context of a realistic eHealth system for a number of complementary development scenarios. |

### Compelled Decryption (by [Dr. Sofie Royer](https://www.law.kuleuven.be/citip/en/staff-members/staff/00105310) and [Ward Yperman](https://www.law.kuleuven.be/strafrecht/english/LedenpaginasENGELS/wyENGELS.html))

| **When** | Thursday, 29 October 2020, 12:30 - 13:30 |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | You have the right to remain silent! But what does that mean when you are forced to provide your smartphone password (or fingerprint) to the police? This is a question many scholars and courts alike have grappled with. The right to remain silent and not incriminate oneself is one of the basic principles of our legal system. While this right seems fairly straightforward, technological change comes with new challenges. In this talk, Sofie Royer and Ward Yperman will explain the scope of the right to silence and shed light on the rules on compelled decryption in Belgium and beyond. This includes the consequences of refusing to provide your password and the countermeasures that one can take in order to protect oneself. |

### Watching IoTs That Watch Us: Empirically Studying IoT Security & Privacy at Scale (by [Prof. Danny Y. Huang](https://mlab.engineering.nyu.edu/))

| **When** | Friday, 16 October 2020, 12:30 - 13:30 |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | Consumers today are increasingly concerned about the security and privacy risks of smart home IoT devices. However, few empirical studies have looked at these problems at scale, partly because a large variety and number of smart-home IoT devices are often closed-source and on private home networks, thus making it difficult for researchers to systematically observe the actual security and privacy issues faced by users in the wild. In this talk, I describe two methods for researchers to empirically understand these risks to real end-users: (i) crowdsourcing network traffic from thousands of real smart home networks, and (ii) emulating user-inputs to study how thousands of smart TV apps track viewers. Both methods have allowed us to conduct the largest security and privacy studies on smart TVs and other IoT devices to date. Our labeled datasets have also created new opportunities for other research areas, such as machine learning, network management, and healthcare. |

### Homomorphic Encryption (by [Prof. Dr. Nigel Smart](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/nigel-smart/))

| **When** | Tuesday, 30 June 2020, 12:30 -- 13:30 |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | In this seminar, Prof. Dr. Nigel Smart will give a talk on computing on encrypted data. He will discuss how the technology of MPC and FHE is changing the way people process data, by allowing them to compute on data whilst it is “encrypted”. He will discuss a number of use cases of the technology. The talk will not go into technical details, and thus you do not need to understand any cryptography for the talk. |

### Ethical Hacking (by [Dr. Sofie Royer](https://www.law.kuleuven.be/citip/en/staff-members/staff/00105310))

| **When** | Tuesday, 05 May 2020, 12:30 -- 13:30 |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | In this seminar, Sofie Royer will give a talk on hacking and its legal implications. We'll first have a look at the basics of criminal law and criminal procedure. What does the offence of hacking look like? Are there any European rules on this topic? From which point can someone be held criminally liable for his or her behavior? Who can decide whether a criminal investigation is initiated? What punishment does someone risk when he or she is found liable for hacking? Does ethical hacking constitute an offence in Belgium? What about other countries? In other words, in this seminar you’ll find out what’s at stake when engaging in hacking activities. |

### Threat modeling: A guided tour (by [Dr. Koen Yskout](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/koeny))

| **When** | Wednesday, 08 April 2020, 12:30 -- 13:30 |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | In this talk, we'll take a tour through the current state of practice regarding threat modeling in software engineering. Starting from the goal of threat modeling, we'll encounter the relation between threats and objectives, risk, design decisions, vulnerabilities, and exploits. We'll look at a few typical threats to software systems, and practical techniques to elicit them (e.g., attack trees, attack libraries, STRIDE, and LINDDUN). We'll finish by  discussing some of the limitations of and hurdles for doing threat  modeling in a modern software development lifecycle and enterprise  environment. |

### The NIS-Directive and the Cybersecurity Act (by [Stefano Fantin](https://www.law.kuleuven.be/citip/en/staff-members/staff/00118311) and [Michiel Fierens](https://www.law.kuleuven.be/citip/en/staff-members/staff/00132752))

| **When** | Tuesday, 03 March 2020, 12:30 -- 13:30 |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | The aim of this presentation is to provide some basic inputs about the most recent legislation on cybersecurity issued by the EU. More specifically, the first part of the presentation will give an overview of the policy landscape that led the law-maker to legislate back in 2015-2016. Having set up the basis (inter alia, touching upon some fundamentals of EU law), we will go through the main parts of the NIS Directive, what obligations the law entails on Member States and economic actors (including on incident reporting), and what lessons we can learn from it. The second part of the presentation will brief on the newly introduced Cybersecurity Act, which regulates on the role of ENISA and a pan-European cybersecurity certification scheme. Finally, we will provide a small overview on how a future EU certification scheme could look like on the basis of the recent ENISA-report. |

### Trusted Execution and how far you can trust it (by [Dr. Jan Tobias Muehlberg](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/muehlber))

| **When** | Tuesday, 07 February 2020, 12:00 -- 13:00 |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | Even the most well-tested software is not secure if it executes on untrusted infrastructure, in an untrusted operating system, or relies on third-party libraries that may contain vulnerabilities. Modern processors provide Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that can protect a software component from low-level attacks, allows remote parties to verify the integrity of that component, and ties execution of the component to a unique trusted element in the execution platform. In this talk Dr. Jan Tobias Muehlberg will give an introduction to software-level vulnerabilities and TEEs, and discuss the security and privacy implications of this technology. |
