## Welcome to the CIF Seminars

An monthly series of interdisciplinary seminars around legal and technical
topics related to cybersecurity and online privacy, organised by the
[CiTiP](https://www.law.kuleuven.be/citip/en/),
[COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), and
[DistriNET](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) research groups of [KU
Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/).

## Next Seminar

### Homomorphic Encryption (by [Prof. Dr. Nigel Smart](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/nigel-smart/))

| **Date and Time** | Tuesday, 30 June 2020, 12:30 -- 13:30 |
| --- | --- |
| **Location** | online only |
| **Conferencing** | [meet.jit.si/20200630-CIF-Homomorphic-Encryption](https://meet.jit.si/20200630-CIF-Homomorphic-Encryption) |
| **Abstract** | In this seminar, Prof. Dr. Nigel Smart will give a talk on computing on encrypted data. He will discuss how the technology of MPC and FHE is changing the way people process data, by allowing them to compute on data whilst it is “encrypted”. He will discuss a number of use cases of the technology. The talk will not go into technical details, and thus you do not need to understand any cryptography for the talk. |

### Trusted Execution and how far you can trust it (by [Dr. Jan Tobias Muehlberg](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/muehlber))

| **Date and Time** | Tuesday, 07 February 2020, 12:00 -- 13:00 |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract** | Even the most well-tested software is not secure if it executes on untrusted infrastructure, in an untrusted operating system, or relies on third-party libraries that may contain vulnerabilities. Modern processors provide Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that can protect a software component from low-level attacks, allows remote parties to verify the integrity of that component, and ties execution of the component to a unique trusted element in the execution platform. In this talk Dr. Jan Tobias Muehlberg will give an introduction to software-level vulnerabilities and TEEs, and discuss the security and privacy implications of this technology. |
